                   <p> Hello, guys. My name is Ana Julia Hiramatsu. I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I like to practice music in my free time. My first interest in programming and web design started when I was 10 years old. I've always wanted to create my own gaming website and I'm almost there. I lacked a lot of knowledge to be 100% complete, but I tried! The link is https://yhayyuka.blogspot.com/</p>
